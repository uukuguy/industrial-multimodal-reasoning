# {Project Name} Architecture Document

## Technical Summary

{Provide a brief (1-2 paragraph) overview of the system's architecture, key components, technology choices, and architectural patterns used. Reference the goals from the PRD.}

## High-Level Overview

{Describe the main architectural style (e.g., Monolith, Microservices, Serverless, Event-Driven). Explain the primary user interaction or data flow at a conceptual level.}

```mermaid
{Insert high-level system context or interaction diagram here - e.g., using Mermaid graph TD or C4 Model Context Diagram}
```

## Component View

{Describe the major logical components or services of the system and their responsibilities. Explain how they collaborate.}

```mermaid
{Insert component diagram here - e.g., using Mermaid graph TD or C4 Model Container/Component Diagram}
```

- Component A: {Description of responsibility}
- Component B: {Description of responsibility}
- {src/ Directory (if applicable): The application code in src/ is organized into logical modules... (briefly describe key subdirectories like clients, core, services, etc., referencing docs/project-structure.md for the full layout)}

## Key Architectural Decisions & Patterns

{List significant architectural choices and the patterns employed.}

- Pattern/Decision 1: {e.g., Choice of Database, Message Queue Usage, Authentication Strategy, API Design Style (REST/GraphQL)} - Justification: {...}
- Pattern/Decision 2: {...} - Justification: {...}
- (See docs/coding-standards.md for detailed coding patterns and error handling)

## Core Workflow / Sequence Diagrams (Optional)

{Illustrate key or complex workflows using sequence diagrams if helpful.}

## Infrastructure and Deployment Overview

- Cloud Provider(s): {e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP, On-premise}
- Core Services Used: {List key managed services - e.g., Lambda, S3, Kubernetes Engine, RDS, Kafka}
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): {Tool used - e.g., AWS CDK, Terraform, Pulumi, ARM Templates} - Location: {Link to IaC code repo/directory}
- Deployment Strategy: {e.g., CI/CD pipeline, Manual deployment steps, Blue/Green, Canary} - Tools: {e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI}
- Environments: {List environments - e.g., Development, Staging, Production}
- (See docs/environment-vars.md for configuration details)
